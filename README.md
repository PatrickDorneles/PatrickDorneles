# Hi there ðŸ‘‹  
I'm a fullstack developer passionate about creating innovative solutions and exploring new technologies.

## Currently Learning ðŸ“•  
I'm studying Software Engineering at EstÃ¡cio de SÃ¡ University. At the same time, I'm deepening my skills in React and Node.js, improving my proficiency with backend technologies like NestJS and PostgreSQL, and expanding my knowledge in DevOps practices. I'm also exploring game development with Godot.
